    "Tokenization is the process of dividing a text string into smaller units known as tokens. In the context of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a popular language model, it is common to tokenize text into tokens with a maximum length of 512 tokens. This limitation arises from the maximum input length that BERT can handle effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform tokenization for BERT, a common approach is to utilize the encode_plus method provided by tokenizers, a widely used library in conjunction with BERT. This method takes the original text as input and returns a list of tokens. It also incorporates special BERT tokens like [CLS], [SEP], and [PAD], which hold specific meanings within the BERT framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the token length, various parameters can be specified. For instance, the max_length parameter can be set to 512, indicating the desired length for the tokenized encodings. If the original text exceeds this limit, truncation can be enabled to remove any excess tokens beyond the specified maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, in cases where the original text is shorter than the desired length, padding can be applied. By setting padding to \"max_length,\" the encoder pads the tokenized encodings with padding tokens until the desired length of 512 tokens is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing these parameters within the encode_plus method, the text can be effectively tokenized into smaller units, special BERT tokens can be added, and the length of the resulting tokenized encodings can be controlled to adhere to BERT's maximum input length of 512 tokens."

It's important to note that we will need to add padding to the final chunk because it won't meet the required tensor size of 512, as specified by BERT.\n",

Since our tokens are already in token ID format, we can refer to the special tokens table mentioned earlier to create the token ID versions of [CLS] and [SEP]. Since we are performing this operation for multiple tensors, we will use a for-loop to concatenate the tokens individually for each chunk. Additionally, when concatenating the attention mask chunks, we use 1s instead of the values 101 and 102. This is because the attention mask doesn't contain token IDs but rather a series of 1s and 0s. In the attention mask, 0s represent the padding token locations, while [CLS] and [SEP] tokens, not being padding tokens, are represented by 1s.\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure that our tensor chunks meet the required length of 512 by BERT, we need to add padding. The first two chunks don't require any padding as they already meet this length requirement. However, the final chunks need padding. To determine if a chunk requires padding, we can use an if-statement to check the tensor length. If the tensor has fewer than 512 tokens, we can add padding using the torch.cat function. This statement should be added within the same for-loop where we added the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens."
