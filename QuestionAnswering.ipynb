In the context of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a popular language model, it is common to tokenize text into tokens with a maximum length of 512 tokens. This limitation arises from the maximum input length that BERT can handle effectively.\n",

It also incorporates special BERT tokens like [CLS], [SEP], and [PAD], which hold specific meanings within the BERT framework.\n",

Since our tokens are already in token ID format, we can refer to the special tokens table mentioned earlier to create the token ID versions of [CLS] and [SEP]. Since we are performing this operation for multiple tensors, we will use a for-loop to concatenate the tokens individually for each chunk. Additionally, when concatenating the attention mask chunks, we use 1s instead of the values 101 and 102. This is because the attention mask doesn't contain token IDs but rather a series of 1s and 0s. In the attention mask, 0s represent the padding token locations, while [CLS] and [SEP] tokens, not being padding tokens, are represented by 1s.\n",

However, the final chunks need padding. To determine if a chunk requires padding, we can use an if-statement to check the tensor length. If the tensor has fewer than 512 tokens, we can add padding using the torch.cat function. This statement should be added within the same for-loop where we added the [CLS] and [SEP] tokens."
